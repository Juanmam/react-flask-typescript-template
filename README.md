# REACT-FLASK-TYPESCRIPT-TEMPLATE
This template is designed to streamline the setup of web-based projects, leveraging a robust tech stack including Flask for the backend, React and TypeScript for the frontend, and MySQL as the database engine. The architecture is containerized using Docker, facilitating both local and on-premise deployment. It features a tripartite container setup, with individual containers dedicated to the backend, frontend, and storage, ensuring a modular and scalable infrastructure. For more information, check the [full documentation online](www.google.com).

## Prerequisites

Before you can utilize this template, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

1. **Docker**: Docker is essential for creating and managing the application's containers. [Download and install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it's not already set up on your system.
2. **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. [Follow the installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for your specific operating system.
3. **Git (Optional)**: While not strictly necessary, having Git installed will make it easier to clone the project repository. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) from the official site.
4. **Node.js and npm (Optional)**: Required if you intend to modify the frontend. While the Docker container will have its own Node.js and npm setup, having these installed on your local machine will allow you to run the frontend outside of Docker and utilize additional tools. [Install Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from the official website.

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can proceed with the installation of the project.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and get the application running:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository directly. Otherwise, you can download the source code as a ZIP file from the repository page.
    ```
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [project-name]
    ```


2. Environment Configuration: Navigate to the env directory. Here, you'll find .env files for the backend, frontend, and database, preconfigured with standard values. Update these files with your local settings.

Database Configuration (db.env):
- DATABASE_NAME: Specify the name of your database.
- DATABASE_USER: Set the username for the database admin.
- DATABASE_PASSWORD: Set the password for the database admin.
- DATABASE_HOST: The hostname for the database service (default is usually db in Docker Compose networks).

Backend Configuration (backend.env):
- FLASK_ENV: Set to development for development environment or production for production.
- DATABASE_URL: The full URL to your database, typically something like postgresql://username:password@db:5432/dbname when using Docker Compose.

Frontend Configuration (frontend.env):
- REACT_APP_API_URL: The URL to your backend API, something like http://localhost:5000 in development.

Edit the .env files to configure your local environment. Ensure the values match your specific requirements and environment.


3. **Build the Containers**: Use Docker Compose to build the application's containers. This command will compile the backend, frontend, and set up the database, creating a cohesive development environment.
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```

4. **Run the Application**: Start the application by running the following command. This will start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
    Your application should now be running, with the frontend accessible via a web browser.

5. **Verifying the Setup**: To ensure everything is set up correctly, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified for your frontend service) in your web browser. You should see your React application's landing page.

6. **Shutting Down**: To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running. To remove the containers, networks, and volumes associated with your project, run:
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! Whether it's improving documentation, fixing bugs, or adding new features, your help is appreciated. Please follow these guidelines to contribute effectively:

1. **Code Style**: Adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project. This includes formatting, naming variables, and organizing files. When working on documentation, please use Sphinx style when working on Python, as the project uses autodoc to keep the project well documented.
2. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the changes made. Use the imperative mood and include a brief description of what was done and why, if it's not immediately obvious.
3. **Pull Requests**: When you're ready to contribute, create a pull request describing your changes. Please ensure that your code has been tested and is free of errors. It's also helpful to reference any relevant issues or discussions in your pull request.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. This ensures that your work aligns with the project's direction and that multiple people aren't working on the same thing.
